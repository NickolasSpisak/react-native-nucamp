# react-native-nucamp

Nick Spisak's React Native project made during my time at Nucamp Bootcamp

This phone application is meant to display campsites, let users pick what time and campsite they want to stay at,
and even leave a rating. 

I hope to use this application as a base for my future applications to build off of and refine my skills
